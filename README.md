## How to run backend

In the backend folder, all the node modules are already uploaded so there is no need to "npm i"

To start the server, you must first make sure to download MongoDB on your local device.

After that, type in the following command in the terminal

### `npm run serverStart`

This should allow you to run the server on http://localhost:3000
