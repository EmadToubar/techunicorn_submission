This project was developed by Emad Toubar as an application for the Tech Unicorn Software Engineering Intern position

## How to run backend

In the backend folder, all the node modules are already uploaded so there is no need to "npm i"

To start the server, you must first make sure to download MongoDB on your local device.

After that, type in the following command in the terminal

### `npm run serverStart`

This should allow you to run the server on http://localhost:3000

## Important notices

1. All the endpoints were tested on VSCode using the REST extension. In the Backend Project folder, there is a file called "route.rest". This file contains all the tests performed on the endpoints.

2. The PDF document in this repo contains the description of all the endpoints impelemented in the system.
